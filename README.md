Exploratory Data Analysis of Netflix titles using synthetic data

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a Netflix-style dataset. Currently, the project includes a Python script and a Jupyter Notebook that generates a synthetic dataset of 1,000 titles to simulate real-world data analysis workflows.

## 📊 Key Features

* **Attributes:** Includes data for Countries (USA, India, UK, etc.), Ratings (TV-MA, PG-13, etc.), and Release Years (2010–2023).
* **Visualization Ready:** The environment is set up with `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for future data plotting.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python 3**
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation.
* **Seaborn & Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
* **Google Colab:** Initial development environment.
